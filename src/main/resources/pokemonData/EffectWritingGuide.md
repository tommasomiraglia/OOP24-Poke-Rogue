*attribute* can be :[\
RANDOM
attackUs.pp,\
attackUs.isPhysical,\
attackUs.accuracy,\
attackUs.critRate,\
attackUs.baseDamage, # damage of move in json\
attackUs.damage, # damage after calculation\
attackUs.type, # Check type enum (strings values)\
attackUs.priority,\
attackEnemy.pp, \
... (same of AttackUs),\
us.stats.hp.current,     # taken from actualStats\
us.stats.hp.max,\
us.stats.attack,\
us.stats.defense,\
us.stats.special-attack,\

enemy.hp ... (same of us),\
weather #Check weather enum (strings values)\
]\
*operand* can be : ["==","<",">","<=",">=","!=","in"]\
